    Homework:
    1. Two Sum

/*
    time complexity:

    capture the time initially <- t1

    do something / run the code / call the function

    capture the time after the code is executed <- t2

    time taken = t2 - t1

    ms / s / microseconds / nanoseconds

    it depends on several factors:
        - the size of the input
        - the complexity of the code
        - the hardware (CPU, RAM, Virtual Memory, Hard Disk or SSD, etc.)

    there is no constant unit of measurement for time complexity -> asymptotic notations
